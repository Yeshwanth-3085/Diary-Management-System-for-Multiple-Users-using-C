# Diary Management System for Multiple Users with Password Protection using C

This application is developed to use as a daily usage diary, which is used to maintain records, to do lists, meetups, etc. for multiple users protected with password.

## Features

- For starters this app is developed for multiple users usage in the sense it can create a new account, login into an existing account & permanently delete an existing account.

- To create a new account there is `int signup(int flag, char EUN[]);` function, which seeks the username & suitable password from the user required to create a new account.

- To log back into an existing account there is `void signin();` function, which seeks the username & passsword from the user to log back in into their account.

- To perform various operation on notes of the diary there is `void menu(char UN[]);` function, which performs 7 operations they are: 

  - Create a Note
  - View a Note
  - Edit a Note
  - Delete a Note or Multiple Notes
  - Edit your Password
  - Permanently Delete your Account
  - Log Out

And there are more sub operations in few of these operations which will be self-descriptive while using these few operations.

## Requirements

- Please store the application & related files in a separate empty folder for it's optimal functioning.  
- The code for this application was written in C to run under the MinGW compiler system, which provides a native Windows port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which is available with CodeBlocks IDE (Recommended to use CodeBlocks IDE's MinGW).  
- It is required if you want to see for yourself how the code works & to make changes in the code.  

If you encounter any bugs, feel free to reach out, and I'll work to resolve them.
